        <p>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a wide
        range of tasks, from designing the user interface to writing code and managing databases.</p>
        <div id="test">Web development can be broadly categorized into front-end development (what users see and interact with), back-end development (server-side logic and databases), and full-stack development (both front-end and back-end).</div>
